## Assignment Submission: Week 1

This repository contains my submission for Week 1 of the Unreal Engine training assignment.

### Description:
In this assignment, I have created a blueprint of a straight staircase. The number of stairs can be adjusted dynamically using the `OnConstruction` function. Additionally, I have implemented functionality to change the type of staircase directly from the editor.

### Features:
- Blueprint of a straight staircase
- Dynamic adjustment of the number of stairs using the `OnConstruction` function
- Ability to change the type of staircase from the editor

### Files:
- `BP_StaircaseActor.uasset`: Blueprint file for the straight staircase
- `README.md`: This README file providing information about the assignment submission

### Usage:
1. Open the project in Unreal Engine.
2. Locate the `BP_StaircaseActor` blueprint in the content browser.
3. Place the blueprint in your level.
4. Adjust the number of stairs and type of staircase as desired using the blueprint properties.

### Notes:
- This submission is part of the Unreal Engine training program and serves as a demonstration of skills learned during Week 1.
- Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
